# Dear Chi Chi,

Happy Valentine's Day! I know we usually don't do anything for this but I figured it would be cute if I sent you this letter (once I manage to get this bloody thing to work ofc). I just wanted to tell you how much I love and cherish you and I hope that our relationship stays strong until we get old and die together (98 years old being the target age :P). Even though there has been A LOT of ups and downs the past 642 days (I did the math :3), there is no one else I would hang out, eat, troll, piss off, and cuddle with.

While on the topic of Valentine's Day, and since we are about to meet in a few days, I would like to officially ask: Would you go out to dinner with me? We can get some classic, knee-slapping bangers that we always eat to celebrate us coming back to Melbourne :3. Although we have been quite busy in our own homes and haven't been able to talk or hang out much, I am still excited as ever to see you especially since it has been such a long time since already. I promise if you do sleep over I will clean my apartment to the best of my ability :).

Here's to a fun and relaxing time in Melbourne together (+ Taytay concert!!) before we officially begin our postgraduate journey!! üçæüçæ I think that we are both scared shitless to start this but I truly feel that we can tackle this head on and actually make it out relatively fine (minus the declining mental health and rapidly rising levels of stress lol). I wish you the best in your degree and I hope that I get to be there with you every step of the way :)

Yours sincerely,
Wuj :3
